        <p class="updated">Last updated: January 15, 2025</p>

        <p>
            Welcome to FittyPal! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the FittyPal mobile
            application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using FittyPal, you agree to be bound by
            these Terms. If you do not agree, please stop using the Service immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            FittyPal is developed and published by Lorenzo Franceschini ("we", "us"). If you have any questions about
            these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fittypal.com">support@fittypal.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            You must be at least 16 years old to use FittyPal. If you are between 16 and 18, you must obtain consent from a
            parent or legal guardian before creating an account or logging workouts in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Health disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            FittyPal is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional
            before beginning a new exercise program. Stop using the app and seek medical help if you experience pain,

        </p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>When using the Service you agree not to:</p>

            <li>Upload content that is illegal, defamatory, or discriminatory.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, copy, or resell any part of the Service.</li>
            <li>Misuse Bluetooth or health data features in ways that violate Apple policies or privacy laws.</li>
            <li>Use automated scripts or bots to interact with the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions and payments</h2>
        <p>
            FittyPal may offer paid plans in the future. Any paid subscription will clearly display pricing, billing cycles,
            and cancellation procedures inside the app and on the App Store listing. Unless required by law, payments are
            non-refundable once a billing period starts.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data & privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Your workout data is stored locally on your device or in iCloud (if enabled). Please review the
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordKenzo/FitnessDiary/main/AppStoreMetadata/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
            to understand how we process personal information and how to request data deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect product updates or legal requirements. When changes are
            made, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted
            constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of Italy. Any disputes will be handled by the courts located in Milan,
            unless local consumer protection laws require otherwise.
