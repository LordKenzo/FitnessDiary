## Notes for Apple Reviewer

FittyPal is an offline-first workout tracking app for personal trainers and athletes.

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Complete the 3-screen onboarding flow
2. Set up your profile (age, gender, weight, height)
   - HealthKit import is optional - you can enter data manually
3. Navigate to "Workout Cards" tab and create a new workout card
4. Add exercises from the pre-populated exercise library
5. Go to "Workout" tab and start a workout
6. (Optional) Connect a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to test HR zones

BLUETOOTH TESTING:
- Any BLE heart rate monitor works (Polar H10, Garmin HRM, etc.)
- Connection is optional - app fully functional without HR monitor
- Bluetooth permission will be requested when attempting to connect

HEALTHKIT TESTING:
- HealthKit permission requested during onboarding
- Can be denied - app works perfectly without it
- If granted, imports weight/height for heart rate zone calculations

The app stores all data locally using SwiftData. No network calls, no servers, complete privacy.

If you don't have a Bluetooth HR monitor, you can still test all other features - the app is designed to work fully offline without any connected devices.
