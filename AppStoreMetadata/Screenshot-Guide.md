## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First Screenshot is Critical** - It's the only one guaranteed to be seen in search results. Make it your best.

2. **Show the App in Action** - Screenshots of active workouts are more engaging than empty states.

3. **Use Dark Mode** - Fitness apps often look better in dark mode (more dramatic, focuses attention).

4. **Avoid Clutter** - Don't show too many features in one screenshot. One feature per image.

5. **Test on Device** - Before finalizing, view screenshots on an actual iPhone to ensure readability.

6. **A/B Test** - After launch, you can update screenshots. Monitor conversion rates and iterate.

7. **Video Preview** - Consider adding an App Preview video (15-30 seconds) showing workout execution flow. This can significantly boost conversions.
